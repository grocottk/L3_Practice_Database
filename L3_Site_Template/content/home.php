                The quick search box above can be easily used to find quotes from a specific author by typing a part of their name, while it can also be used to search for quotes on a specific subject. Other ways to find quotes include by looking through all of the database, searching through 10 random quotes, and by viewing the quotes most recently added to the database (all of these ordering options can be seen in the above navigation bar).
